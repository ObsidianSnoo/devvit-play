<!-- to-do: add <play-pen> integration note. -->

See the [changelog](changelog.md) for release notes.

### Artifacts

Published each release and under `dist/`:

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit **[http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)** in your web browser.

See [supplemental development notes](docs/development.md).

### NPM scripts

- `install`: install play dependencies.
- `start`: run development server.
- `test`: build play and execute all tests. Anything that can be validated
  automatically before publishing runs through this command.
- `run test:unit`: run the unit tests. Pass `--update` to update all test
  snapshots.
- `run format`: apply lint fixes automatically where available.
- `run build`: compile source inputs to artifacts under `dist/`.
- `publish`: publish a new version to NPM. See
  [versioning](docs/versioning.md).<!-- to-do: add -->

ðŸ’¡ Add `--` to pass arguments to the script command. For example,
`npm run test:unit -- --update` to update snapshots.

### Project Structure

- **docs**/: play documentation.
- **examples**/: projects that play well.
- **src**/: source inputs.
- **tools**/: development tools.

### Tagging

Coupling that is difficult to express with tooling is tagged as helpful. Eg,
`#strings:description#` or `#version#`. This makes it easier to see all the
places a cross-cutting concern touches with a grep. Eg, `rg '#theme#'`. See all
tags used with `rg '#[a-z0-9:-]+#'`.

### Contribution Guidelines and Design Principles

- Make it fun. play must be fun to use and fun to develop. Speed and quality are
  play's top two features.
- Avoid dependencies. Dependencies are high-cost integrations. Simply don't add
  them.
- Avoid code. Lines of code are costly. We probably can't afford your code if
  you write a lot of it.
- Open-source for everyone. This repo was started with the intention to be
  open-sourced as soon as possible.
  - Avoid closed-source Reddit dependencies. All dependencies must be available
    publicly.
  - Avoid Reddit-specific branding.
- Code should be written to be read. We value good context. This often means
  including short inline or accompanying docs.
- Keep the interface and outputs plain and simple. play is only a tool. The
  user's focus is their work.
- Every commit should be an overall improvement. If every commit is an
  improvement, the code only gets better.
- Smaller patches get better reviews.
